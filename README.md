# TinyApp Project
A quick and easy way to shorten long URLs!

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten any URL quickly and safely (Ã  la bit.ly). Users can create private accounts where they can: keep track of their created short links, update, and delete them. These short links can then be shared with anyone. Talk about convenient!
